Make all the data .csv files in the data repository with the following R scripts in the same folder. 
(I). Visualization with the Econometrics Regression.
Generating the main figures and the benchmark regression results for the interactive fixed effects from the major script, IFE.R. 
The script, present.R , separately visualizes the Dependent Variables and Explanatory Variables for the interactive models.

(II). Results with the Machine Learning Algorithms.
The script, kmeans.R , presents the group results from K-means algorithm in the robustness checks. 
The script, CART.R, illustrates the classification and regression trees results in the robustness checks.
